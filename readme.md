imagine if you could play the bee movie on a hardware chal.

if you want to procure the bee movie i could or could not possibly lead you to it 

codex generated a lovely readme.md in the bee_movie folder for the intricate details but essentially you need to get a file named bee_movie.mp4 into this folder and then run

> python3 bee_movie/stream_bee_movie.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 --fps 60 --drop-frames --dither atkinson --gamma 1.2 --contrast 5.2 --brightness -10 --preview

it takes a fair bit of tweeking with the contrast to get it to not look like shit

all credit to ai where due and @cryptoalgorithm for the cool hardware
